Cybersecurity Labs & Projects

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository contains hands-on projects completed through academic coursework, personal labs, and cybersecurity practice environments. These projects demonstrate my growing skills in network analysis, incident response, vulnerability assessment, and security operations as I pursue my Master’s degree in Cybersecurity.

About Me

I am an entry-level cybersecurity professional and current Master’s student focused on developing practical, real-world skills in:
	•	Security event and incident analysis
	•	Network traffic inspection
	•	Linux system administration
	•	Vulnerability identification
	•	Malware file classification
	•	Technical report writing
	•	Security documentation & assessments

This repository serves as a showcase of my technical learning and growth.

 Projects Included in This Repository

1. Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis
	•	Captured and analyzed packets from simulated network environments.
	•	Applied filters to identify suspicious traffic and potential IoCs.
	•	Documented findings such as unusual HTTP requests, scanning attempts, and anomalies.
	•	Tools: Wireshark, tcpdump

2. Security Event & Incident Report
	•	Investigated Apache log files to identify indicators of compromise.
	•	Detected repeated brute-force attempts, reconnaissance behavior, and shellshock exploitation probes.
	•	Used Dradis to structure findings, evidence, and recommendations.
	•	Tools: Linux CLI, Dradis, TRID, log analysis techniques

3. Linux Security & System Administration Labs
	•	Performed user and permission management.
	•	Analyzed system logs for suspicious activity.
	•	Practiced directory management, file editing, and secure configurations.
	•	Tools: Linux (Ubuntu/Kali), nano, grep, chmod, system logs

4. Malware File Identification with TRID
	•	Used TRID to classify unknown file types and detect malicious indicators.
	•	Performed initial triage and documented risk levels.
	•	Tools: TRID, hash generation, VirusTotal

5. Cybersecurity Tools & Techniques Documentation
	•	Detailed walkthroughs of tools used during labs.
	•	Notes and procedures for:
	•	Vulnerability scanning
