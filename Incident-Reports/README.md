Security Incident Reports

This folder contains formal cybersecurity incident investigation reports based on real log analysis, Wireshark captures, threat detection exercises, and hands-on security investigations performed during my Master’s program and personal lab environment.
Each report follows a structured SOC workflow, documenting evidence, findings, indicators of compromise (IoCs), root cause, and recommended remediation steps.

 Skills Demonstrated
	•	Threat detection & event triage
	•	Log file investigation (Apache, HTTP, access logs)
	•	Packet capture (PCAP) review
	•	Artifact extraction and classification
	•	Identifying IoCs such as malicious IP addresses
	•	Analyzing suspicious HTTP requests and network behavior
	•	Recognizing brute-force, scanning, and exploitation attempts
	•	Writing structured, professional incident reports
	•	Root cause and impact assessment
	•	Remediation & mitigation strategy creation


1. Security Event & Incident Reports (PDF format)

These reports include:
	•	Executive summary
	•	Timeline of events
	•	Attack vector analysis
	•	Evidence screenshots
	•	Log excerpts
	•	PCAP investigation notes
	•	TRiD file classification results
	•	IoCs (IPs, URLs, file hashes, filenames)
	•	Conclusion and recommended corrective actions

2. Supporting Evidence (Screenshots & Notes)

Evidence may include:
	•	Suspicious access-log entries
	•	Packet behaviors (e.g., unusual HTTP objects, JPEG disguised EXE files)
	•	Extracted file metadata
	•	Indicators of exploitation (e.g., attempts to access xmlrpc.php)
	•	Anomalous traffic patterns or repeated scanning attempts


3. Investigation Workflow

Each incident report demonstrates the following steps:

1. Detection
Identification of unusual or malicious activity through logs or network captures.

2. Evidence Collection
Extraction of log lines, packets, artifacts, and metadata.

3. Analysis
Deep inspection of traffic, user-agent strings, file types, and attacker behavior.

4. Findings
Summary of malicious indicators such as:
	•	suspicious foreign IP addresses
	•	brute-force attempts
	•	shellshock patterns
	•	exploit attempts
	•	unauthorized file transfers

5. Impact Assessment
Evaluation of what systems, data, or services may have been affected.

6. Recommended Actions
Clear remediation steps such as blocking IPs, hardening systems, patching vulnerabilities, and improving monitoring rules.


Tools Used
	•	Wireshark (packet capture and HTTP object extraction)
	•	Linux utilities (grep, cat, tail for log analysis)
	•	TRiD File Identifier (artifact classification)
	•	Windows Command Line (file type analysis)
	•	Cybersecurity methodologies (SOC workflow)


 Purpose of This Folder

This section of my portfolio demonstrates my ability to:
	•	Perform real cybersecurity investigations
	•	Analyze complex evidence
	•	Think like an attacker and defender
	•	Produce clear, structured incident documentation
	•	Apply industry-standard SOC and IR practices

This work aligns with the responsibilities of:
	•	SOC Analyst (Tier 1 / Tier 2)
	•	Cybersecurity Incident Response Technician
	•	Information Security Analyst
