Cybersecurity Tools & Techniques used

This folder contains documentation, demonstrations, and hands-on notes on the cybersecurity tools and investigative techniques used during my academic coursework and personal lab exercises. These tools support malware analysis, artifact extraction, SIEM operations, vulnerability scanning, hashing, and general defensive security workflow.

Tools Covered

1. Wireshark*
- Packet capture analysis  
- Identifying suspicious HTTP requests  
- Analyzing transferred files and exportable objects  
- Detecting malware disguised as image files  
- Investigating IP addresses and host communications  

2. TRiD File Identifier*
- Determining file types and signatures  
- Detecting executables disguised as JPEG files  
- Supporting malware triage workflow  
- Classifying unknown or suspicious file artifacts  

3. Dradis Framework*
- Reporting and documentation tool  
- Used to compile vulnerability findings  
- Organizing IoCs, screenshots, and investigation notes  
- Exporting structured security reports

4. Linux Command-Line Tools*
- File permissions investigations  
- Log inspection and filtering (grep, cat, less)  
- Directory and file management  
- Simple scripting for automation  
- Identifying suspicious activity in log files  

5. Vulnerability Scanning & Assessment Tools*
- Fundamentals of vulnerability identification  
- Basic scanning concepts  
- Understanding common security misconfigurations  
- Recognizing indicators of compromise (IoCs)

6. SIEM Fundamentals*
- Log ingestion and event monitoring concepts  
- Pattern recognition and triage  
- Event correlation basics  
- Detecting brute-force attempts, enumeration activity, and exploit behavior  

 Techniques Demonstrated

- Packet inspection and HTTP object extraction  
- Malware artifact detection  
- Hash comparison and file integrity validation  
- Structured documentation of findings  
- Evidence-based reporting and escalation  
- Pattern recognition across logs and network traffic  
- Workflow organization for SOC investigations  

Screenshots and Evidence

This folder includes screenshots from hands-on investigations involving:
- TRiD analysis results  
- Wireshark scans  
- Extracted suspicious files  
- Tools used in vulnerability identification and report creation  

Screenshots support real-world SOC workflows and demonstrate technical proficiency with each tool.

Summary

The Tools & Techniques section highlights my practical cybersecurity skills through the use of:
- Packet analysis
